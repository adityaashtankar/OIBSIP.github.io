<p id="description">Objective: <br>1.The objective of this project is to create a basic calculator web application that allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition subtraction multiplication and division. <br>2.The calculator will have a user-friendly interface and will be built using HTML for the structure CSS for styling and JavaScript for handling the calculations. <br>
Implementation:<br> The implementation of the project will involve the following steps: <br>1. HTML Structure: Create the basic HTML structure for the calculator including the display area and keypad buttons. <br>2. CSS Styling: Apply CSS styling to make the calculator visually appealing and responsive. JavaScript Logic: <br> 3. Implement the JavaScript code to handle user input perform calculations and update the display in real-time. <br> 4. Testing: Test the calculator thoroughly to ensure all arithmetic operations work correctly and error handling functions as expected. <br>5. Once the project is complete users will be able to perform basic calculations conveniently through the web application. They can use this calculator for everyday arithmetic tasks without the need to install any software on their devices.</p>
